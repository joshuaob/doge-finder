# The Objective

The objective of our coding challenge is to assess your technical skills and give us an idea of how you approach programming assignments.

# The Challenge

Design a simple web form, which has a text input field, labeled "Breed" and a "Submit" button. When the form is submitted, a dog breed image should be fetched from [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) and presented, along with the submitted dog breed name. The specification has been kept purposefully loose to allow you to show off your skills however you please.

# Our Requirements

Please use Ruby on Rails, Bootstrap/Tailwind, and Git and provide automated tests. Use Ruby when calling the API, and make sure the form submission is handled asynchronously, without a full page reload. Your solution should be submitted as a public Github repository and hosted on a free hosting provider. Please aim to complete the coding challenge in less than 3 days upon receiving this instruction.
